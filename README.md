This project aims to automate the retrieval of datasets from Kaggle, creating a pipeline to upload the data to a datalake (GCP), setting up another pipeline to move the data to a Data Warehouse (BQ), transforming the data (using Spark), and leaving it in the data mart for querying by a dashboard (Looker Studio).
